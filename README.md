 I am practicing here to try to reproduce the content of this article https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01159

to do:
	- replace the resnet18-discriminator by a "LeNet-like architecture with 16 layers"
	- evaluate the MSE, PSNR, SSIM of the 2 approach on a test set
	- Incorporating optical flow prior approach
